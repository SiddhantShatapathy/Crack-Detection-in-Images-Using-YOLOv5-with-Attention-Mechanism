## Introduction
Defect detection is crucial for maintaining safety and quality in industries such as
aerospace, automotive, and construction. Traditional methods often fail to identify
subtle and camouflaged defects. This thesis explores the use of the YOLOv5 object
detection model, enhanced with the Convolutional Block Attention Module (CBAM),
to improve the detection of these concealed defects. YOLOv5 with CBAM boosts the
modelâ€™s precision and focus, resulting in more accurate detection of subtle defects,
specifically in MPI materials.
Our proposed model, the enhanced YOLOv5 with CBAM, outperforms the baseline
by 2.16% in mAP50-95. This significant improvement demonstrates the effectiveness
of integrating attention mechanisms into object detection models. Additionally,
we developed another model incorporating patch-wise attention to focus on areas with
cracks. While this model does not surpass the CBAM-enhanced model, it performs
as well as the baseline and yields better results in specific cases, showing its potential
in particular scenarios.
To address the lack of specific data for training and testing these new proposed
models, we created a new synthetic dataset. This dataset is designed to simulate realworld
conditions of defect detection, particularly targeting subtle and camouflaged
defects in MPI (Magnetic Particle Inspection) materials. The synthetic dataset is
used to train and evaluate these models specific to our task.
Our work demonstrates the effectiveness of advanced detection algorithms like
YOLOv5 combined with attention mechanisms such as CBAM. It lays a strong foundation
for further research, suggesting a promising future for deploying deep learning
technologies in industrial quality control. This research highlights the potential for
ongoing innovation in automated defect detection, paving the way for more reliable
and efficient inspection processes.
